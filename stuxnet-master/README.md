# Why a license
Many of you might find it wrong that both I and Mr. Amr Thabet copyrighted our code, I mean it is "stolen" code extracted from malware binaries, right?

I understand that it might look silly, but both of us spent hundreds, if not thousands, of hours between ASM code trying to figure out what was behind those binaries and we are providing the product of our hard work (i.e. readable C code) to you for free.
It is not a simple job and it is not a short job, both our licenses are extremely permissive, you can do whatever you want with the code provided in this repository, the only thing I'd like to ask you is that our job get recognized and that when you use this code for analysis, blog posts, or university thesis you show us your support by giving us credit for what we did.

That's all. Thanks to all of you!
